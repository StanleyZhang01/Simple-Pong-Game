Welcome to the Pong Game Code!

This is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game Pong using Python and the Turtle library. The game features two paddles controlled by the players and a ball that bounces back and forth between them. The objective is to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. Use [W,D] AND [Up, Down] keys to control each paddel.
